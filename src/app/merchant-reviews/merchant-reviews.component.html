              <td class="review">One of the busiest outlet of paradise, I was awestruck when I saw the crowd there! Feels really good to see an ambience full of foodies.
                I was there for a food review session! Like any other outlet Gachibowli Paradise is also serving Haleem this 
                year and we were their to taste this authentic 
                100% meat haleem. It was served with pure ghee, fried onions and a lot of love. 
                Donâ€™t miss it because you get a free coke with every haleem.
                We also tried their chicken biryani and mutton haleem which were decent! I hope they level up again and work on it 
                because there are lot of places in hyderabad which is serving better Biryani and talking about the kebabs again it needs a 
                lot of improvement. It actually tasted same expect Reshmi kebabs and Malai tikka kebab.
                Thankyou!</td>
